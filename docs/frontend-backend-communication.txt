The communication method is quite simple in this application.

Main Logic : The front-end (javaScript in our case) read the data from the user and will send the whole file data to the backend
             (C++ in our case), the backend will process the request and for it to process the request there certain rules to follow
             while making request to the backend, like the case in which the operation has to be requested, parameters required with
             the particular operation.

             This way the backend can process the operation and send back the request (if request any) or even perform a process.
             In case if a bad request is made then the error response of the same will be send back to the frontend containing with
             the status code of 500 (bad_request) and also will send the common status code for certain errors such as 400, 404 etc.
            
             So the whole communication relies of making request following the guidelines strictly.

             **Note** : The whole communication is done through JSON.

Rules:

  (1) Naming Rules: The requested operation parameter must be of type string and should be in kabab-case (example: hello-world),
                    no capital letter should be used.

  (2) Request Parameters: Compulsary parameters = request (Only 'post' method should be passed),
                                                  operation (Take a look at the available operations with their parameters)
                                                  headers (should be equal to "application/json")
                                                  body (must be in JSON format)

                                                  (other are the parameter specified my the specific operation)

  (3) Response: The response will be in string format, which will only contain two type of output that is "true" or "false",
                simply due which the frontend can have more flexibility and can easily understand where the operation was
                executed successfully or not. In case of some issue in parameters or request then the neccessary error message
                with status code will be provided.
